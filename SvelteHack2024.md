# SvelteHack 2024

Here's a summary of how we took advantage of Svelte's features to build a dynamic color palette generator:

- Repurposed Svelte's easing functions as mathematical models to generate color variations
- Dynamic reactive SVG favicon
- Leverages the new Context API for the complex color state management
- Uses the transition's API for component reveals and state changes
